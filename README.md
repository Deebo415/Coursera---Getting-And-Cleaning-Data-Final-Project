This file is a reference for grading or if using the "run_analysis.R" script. This README file explains how all of the scripts work
and how they are connected.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The following things should have been submitted:

1) a tidy data set as described below 
2) a link to this Github repository with the script for performing the analysis (run_analysis.R)
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data that isn't
necessarily obvious to an outside observer (CodeBook.md). 

Project Background:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up 
are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

The R script "run_analysis.R" should:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject.

In addition to this outline, comment lines will be put into the "run_analysis.R" script itself to walk the reader/grader
through the steps used to achieve the objectives of this project.

Thanks!
